# Simple SVG Editor

This code defines an SVG canvas element and three buttons that allow the user to add circles, rectangles, or clear the canvas. When the user clicks the "Add Circle" button, the `addCircle()` function creates a new `<circle>` element with a random position and a blue fill color, and appends it to the canvas. When the user clicks the "Add Rectangle" button, the `addRect()` function creates a new `<rect>` element with a random position and a red fill color, and appends it to the canvas. When the user clicks the "Clear Canvas" button, the `clearCanvas()` function removes all child elements from the canvas. You can modify the code to add more shapes or editing functions as desired.
